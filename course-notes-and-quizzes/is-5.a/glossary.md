**1-percent annual chance floodplain:** This is the boundary of the flood that has a 1-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Also known as the 100-year floodplain.

**1-percent annual chance water-surface elevation:** The height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of the flood having a 1-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given flood year (also known as the 100-year flood or the base flood).

**100-year flood:** The flood having a 1-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year; also known as the base flood. The 1-percent annual chance flood, which is the standard used by most Federal and state agencies, is used by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as the standard for floodplain management and to determine the need for flood insurance. A structure located within a special flood hazard area shown on an NFIP map has a 26 percent chance of suffering flood damage during the term of a 30-year mortgage.

**Letter of Map Change (LOMC):** A LOMC is a letter which reflects an official change to an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). LOMCs are issued in response to a request for FEMA to amend or revise its effective flood map to remove a property or reflect changed flooding conditions on the effective map. When certain technical or scientific evidence is available that proves that a property has been inadvertently mapped in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), or flood hazard data needs to be revised due to man-made changes, a request to FEMA for a LOMC may be submitted. For more information on LOMCs, select this link.

**Manning’s “n” Roughness Coefficient:** Coefficient used to account for the friction caused by earthen, vegetative, and/or manmade surfaces within a floodplain cross-section. The coefficient, n, is commonly used to represent flow resistance for hydraulic computations of flow in open channels. The procedure for selecting n values is subjective and requires judgment and skill that is developed primarily through experience. The expertise necessary for proper selection of n values can be obtained in part by examining characteristics of channels that have known or verified roughness coefficients. A table of Manning\` values is available from the pull-down menu in the Quick-2 program.
