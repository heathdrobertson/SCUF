# WUI Stratagies & Tactics

> **SCUF – Fire Officer Development Training**

## SCENARIO DESCRIPTION

On 09/01/25 at approximately 1400, a fast-moving wildfire was reported in the Daniel-Merna area on the Dry-Beaver Road. The reporting party told 911-Dispatch the fire is moving quickly East toward the Jim Bridger Estates subdivision. Multiple 911 calls indicate a large fire plume can be seen from the Daniel and Pinedale area. Multiple SCUF Battalions have been paged to respond to the incident. The USFS has been notified and are in route with one Type 3 Engine and one Type 3 helicopter for recon. The Incident Commander has established “Spring Creek” Incident Command, and assigned incoming resources to perimeter control, evacuations, and structure protection.

### FUEL:

* Energy Release Component (ERC’s) are near record levels. Fuel Moisture Content measurements are critical. Sage/Grass component fuels will carry fire when light wind is present. Heavy fuels and north aspects and stringers will be very receptive to ignition.

### WEATHER:

* Winds are out of the West at 15 MPH, with gusts to 25 MPH. Relative Humidity (RH) is measured at 20% and dropping. Temperature is currently 75 degrees and rising. Spot Weather Forecast indicates a continued drying trend in the 3-5 day forecast with afternoon thunderstorms likely, outflow winds up to 30 MPH possible, and dry lightning is possible.

### TOPOGRAPHY:

* Terrain influence is channeling winds in a West-to-East direction in alignment with the slopes and available fuels. Slopes are generally less than 35% incline.

### FIRE BEHAVIOR:

* Fire activity is significant when the fire is burning up slopes when in alignment with wind and available fuels. Group tree torching and short run crown fire runs are occurring. Spotting is being observed 0.25 – 0.5 mile in distance. The fire modeling predicts the fire will impact the Jim Bridger Estates Subdivision in approximately 24 hours.

### ASSIGNMENT:

You are the Engine Boss (ENGB) of a SCUF Type 5 Engine with four (4) personnel total including yourself on the engine. You have been assigned to the Structure Protection Group with three (3) other SCUF wildfire engines. You just reported to Staging at the entrance to the Jim Bridger Estates Subdivision. Your supervisor is the Structure Protection Group Supervisor (BC1-Nickey). You have been assigned to complete structure triage for the Jim Bridger Estates Subdivision and categorize structures as Defensible – Prep and Hold; Defensible – Standalone; Non-Defensible – Prep and Leave; or Non-Defensible – Rescue Drive-By (_see Triage Categories Handout_). Your supervisor also asked you to recommend tactical actions based on defensibility of the structures (_see WUI Structure Defense Tactical Actions Handout_). Use S-FACTS to set priorities and make decisions about structure defense tactics and resource assignments (_see Structure Triage Decision Process S-FACTS Handout_). After debriefing your supervisor about your recommended tactical actions for the threatened homes, your next assignment is to coordinate with the other resources in the Structure Protection Group and implement protective actions. Brief your assigned personnel about what protective actions you will take in the subdivision.

## STRUCTURE TRIAGE CATEGORIES

\


In many instances there are not enough firefighting resources to defend all structures immediately threatened. Save the structures that are most easily defended first before putting effort into those that will need further preparation to defend (_See IRPG pgs 13-14_).

### DEFENSIBLE – PREP AND HOLD

Determining Factor: Safety zone present.

Sizeup: Structure has some tactical challenges.

Tactics: Firefighters needed on site to implement structure protection tactics during fire front contact.

### DEFENSIBLE – STANDALONE

Determining Factor: Safety zone present.

Sizeup: Structure has very few tactical challenges.

Tactics: Firefighters may not need to be directly assigned to protect structure as it is not likely to ignite during initial fire front contact. However, no structure in the path of a wildfire is completely without need of protection. Patrol following the passage of the fire front will be needed to protect the structure.

### NON-DEFENSIBLE – PREP AND LEAVE

Determining Factor: NO safety zone present.

Sizeup: Structure has some tactical challenges.

Tactics: Firefighters not able to commit to stay and protect structure. If time allows, rapid mitigation measures may be performed. Set trigger point for safe retreat. _Remember, pre-incident preparation is the responsibility of the homeowner_. Patrol following the passage of the fire front will be needed to protect the structure.

### NON-DEFENSIBLE – RESCUE DRIVE-BY

Determining Factor: NO safety zone present.

Sizeup: Structure has significant tactical challenges.

Tactics: Firefighters not able to commit to stay and protect structure. If time allows, check to ensure that people are not present in the threatened structure (especially children, elderly, and those with disabilities). Set trigger point for safe retreat. Patrol following the passage of the fire front will be needed to protect the structure

{% hint style="info" %}
_The Structure Triage language contained in this guide is technical, i.e. the terminology describes tactical or operational actions or decisions. When communicating with the public or the media, the bottom line is that firefighters will risk lives to save lives. When it comes to structures, firefighters will take mitigated risk when and where appropriate. However, when faced with a choice of which home to defend and a limited number of resources, firefighters will choose to take a stand where they have a fighting chance to defend the home._
{% endhint %}

## WUI STRUCTURE DEFENSE TACTICAL ACTIONS

* Prep & Hold
  * Appropriate when a Safety Zone is present. Adequate time exists to prepare the structure for defense prior to fire front impact. Escape routes must be maintained.
* Standalone
  * Firefighters may not need to be directly assigned to protect structure as it is not likely to ignite during initial fire front contact. Patrol following the passage of the fire front will be needed to protect the structure.
* Prep & Leave
  * Structure preparation can be safely completed prior to fire front impact. Potential fire activity is too dangerous to remain and/or there is no Safety Zone present. LEAVE before escape routes are compromised.
* Rescue Drive-By
  * Most appropriate action when no Safety Zone is present and fire front impact is imminent. Conduct rapid evaluation to check for occupants and evaluate for follow up action. LEAVE promptly.

### ADDITIONAL TACTICAL OPTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION

* Fire Front Following
  * Follow-up tactic after passage of the fire front. Involves searching for victims, perimeter control, hot spotting, and ember control.
* Bump & Run
  * Resources move ahead of the fire front extinguishing spot fires and defending structures. Utilize extreme caution.
* Anchor & Hold
  * Resources use large volume fire streams to extinguish structure fires, stop structure-to-structure ignitions, protect exposures, and control embers.
* Tactical Patrol – Resources remain mobile and continuously monitor assigned area after fire front passage. Involves aggressive mop up around structures.

#### &#x53;_&#x74;ructure defense tactics are a vital part of perimeter control operations._

* _Stopping fire spread significantly eliminates the fire’s threat to structures._
* _Connect contained points along the fire’s perimeter – typically near the structures at risk (“Connect the Dots”)._
* _Perimeter control and structure defense should be done concurrently._

### Point Protection

* A wildfire strategy which protects specific assets or critical values from the wildfire without directly halting the continued spread of the wildfire. It involves strategically deploying firefighting resources to secure values during an active fire. Point protection may involve a small-scale tactical firing operation to protect value at risk. The firing operation is a defensive tactical operation to create a buffer between the fire’s edge and the control line to reinforce the control line. The firing operation is low intensity and must be controlled by firefighters prior to leaving the tactical area. The tactic may be used when there is ample time to create a sufficient burn zone around a structure or buffer along the edge of a control line. All firing operations shall be communicated to the appropriate ICS supervisor prior to the commencement of the firing operation. _It is unacceptable to allow applied fire to run uncontrolled, impacting personnel or other structures downwind or up slope._

Point Protection _(continued)_

\


### Firing Around a Structure

Firefighters can use the basic firing patterns and their variations to defend structures when direct attack is not a viable option. The goal is to create additional defensible space around the structure without creating a head fire. This creates a larger burn zone between the main fire and the structure and decreases potential for ignition from radiant heat.

* Ensure sufficient resources with appropriate supervision, experience, and qualifications are on site prior to beginning firing operation.
* Scout the area to be fired to identify and mitigate any potential problems.
* Identify anchor and termination points for the firing operation. If natural or constructed barriers are not present, use check lines.
* Brief supervisors, participants (holding team, ignition team, lookouts), and adjoining resources.
* Identify or create control lines (hand line/dozer line, natural or constructed barriers, wet lines applied prior to or after ignition, and retardant lines)
* Prep the structure and the area around it. Remove flammable vegetation and apply foams or gels as needed. Cover openings (doors, windows, vents) and remove flammable furniture and vegetation under and around decks.
* Put firing team, holding team, and safety resources in place.
* Notify supervisors, participants, and adjoining resources that the firing operation will begin.
* Conduct a test burn.
* Begin the firing operation. Start slow, applying only as much fire as needed to meet objectives. Modify patterns as necessary to achieve objectives.
* Utilize holding forces to suppress spot fires and decrease intensity, as necessary.
* Terminate the firing operation if it achieves its objectives or conditions make continued firing undesirable.
* Suppress the applied fire, and mop up and secure the area.

## STRUCTURE TRIAGE DECISION PROCESS (S-FACTS)

### SURVIVAL

* Initial Assessment: can you survive here? If not, LEAVE NOW!
* Is there a Safety Zone nearby? If not, LEAVE NOW! _(IRPG)_
* Do you have a viable Escape Route?
* What is the decision point at which you will leave based on fire behavior and rate of spread?
* Is there a Temporary Refuge Area (TRA) on site? If not, LEAVE NOW!
  * Preplanned area for immediate, temporary refuge
    * Use of fire shelter should not be necessary
  * Is there a viable Escape Route to the TRA or Safety Zone?
* Is “Prep and Go” tactic an option?
* Do you have communications with your supervisor and adjoining forces?
* If safety issues cannot be mitigated, LEAVE NOW!

### FIRE ENVIRONMENT

* Can you survive based on current and expected fire behavior? If not, LEAVE NOW!
* Look up, Look Down, Look Around Indicators:
  * Fuels (characteristics, moisture, temperature)
    * What will the intensity of the fire be when it arrives?
    * How long will it take to consume the fuels?
  * Wind
    * Current speed/direction
    * Expect changing winds
  * Terrain
    * Are you in a chute, chimney, or saddle? If yes, LEAVE NOW!
      * Is wind in alignment with topography?
      * What is your position relative to topography?
      * Are you mid slope or on top of a ridge?
  * Atmospheric Stability
  * Fire Behavior (requires constant monitoring)
    * Spotting, crowning, sheeting, rate of spread?
    * Flame length and height?
* Other weather considerations:
  * What is the current relative humidity?
    * Is there an expected change?
  * Are thunderstorms forecasted?

### ACCESS

* Is access compatible with time and distance factors necessary to utilize as an Escape Route to a Safety Zone?
  * Road surface adequate for speed necessary?
  * Adequate width? - Turnaround/turnouts?
  * Bridges within limits for fire apparatus?
  * Drainage ditches/culverts?
  * Steep grades?
  * Is there a safe place to spot apparatus?

### CONSTRUCTION/CLEARANCE

* Does the structure have adequate defensible space, based on topography, fuels, and current and expected fire behavior?
* Can defensible space problems be mitigated quickly?
* Will building materials and yard clutter compromise safety?
* Is the construction wood siding or shake shingle roof?
* Are there vent openings, open eaves, large glass windows facing fire front, decks with vegetation below?
  * Will ember intrusion through attic or foundation vents be a problem?
* What are the contents in the garage and outbuildings?
* Are there hazardous materials present?
* Are there propane tanks, fuel tanks, or power lines?
* Is there an adequate water supply nearby?
* Are additional resources needed to mitigate issues?
* Consider “Prep and Go” or “Prep and Defend” tactics

### TIME CONSTRAINTS

* Is there time for an adequate size up of the structure defense problem?
* Is there time to mitigate safety concerns?
* Is there time and adequate resources to properly prepare and defend the structure?
* Is there time to escape, utilizing Escape Routes, to a Safety Zone? If not, LEAVE NOW!

### STAY OR GO

* Tactical decision based on the S-FACTS
* Is it safe to stay? If no, utilize “Check and Go” tactic
* Is there time to prepare the structure for defense and what will the fire behavior be when the fire gets here?
* “Prep and Go” or “Fire Front Following” tactics should be used when it is not safe to “Prep and Defend”

### SAFETY ZONES AND TEMPORARY REFUGE AREAS

To ensure personnel safety during WUI operations, firefighters must identify and evaluate escape routes, safety zones, temporary refuge areas, and potential shelter deployment zones before they are needed. Identifying these areas is a critical component of TACTICAL ENGAGEMENT. Consider the location and viability of these areas when developing a plan, conducting size up and structure triage, and choosing appropriate tactics for structure defense. Without an identified escape route, temporary refuge area, and safety zone, firefighters should not begin tactical engagement in an area.

<table><thead><tr><th width="207.6328125" valign="top">ZONE / AREA</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th><th>EXAMPLE</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">ESCAPE ROUTE</td><td>An identified route used to withdraw from a tactical work area to a pre-determined safety zone or temporary refuge area. The route should be clear of obstructions that could hinder a safe and hasty withdrawal. When escape routes deviate from a defined physical path, they should be clearly marked (flagged).

## STRUCTURE PROTECTION TACTICS&#x20;

_(See IRPG pg. 15)_

### Rapid Mitigation Measures

• Remove small combustibles and woodpiles from immediately next to structure.

• Close windows and doors, including garage (leave unlocked).

• Clean area around fuel tank and shut off tank.

• Charge garden hoses.

• Apply Class A foam, or gel retardants if available (generally foam lasts a short period of time depending on weather conditions).

### Equipment and Water Use

• Mark entrance to indicate a staffed location if it is not obvious.

• Charge hose lines.

• Long hose lays are not recommended.

• Keep 100 gallons of water in reserve.

• Identify a backup water source.

• Identify powerlines for aerial resources.

• Never rely on water for firefighter safety.

### Patrol Following the Fire Front

• Many structures do not burn until after the fire front has passed.

• Be aware of the structural collapse zone when structures are exposed to fire.

• Move to closest safety zone and let fire front go through.

• Return as soon as conditions allow safe access to structures.

• Secondary ignition is usually due to residual spot fires or creeping ground fire.

• Take suppression actions within your capability.

• Call for assistance if needed.

#### Additional Considerations:

* Back equipment in for tactical mobility
* Shield apparatus from radiant heat – be aware of structure ignition potential
* Park in a cleared area (watch for power lines, trees)
* Have an engine/crew protection line identified
* Determine if residents are home. Determine best course of action – evacuate if safe to do so or shelter in place at safe location
* Maintain communications with all crew members
* Top off your tank at every opportunity (use garden hose)
* For roof access, place owner’s ladder at a corner of the structure on the side with the least fire threat and away from power drop
* Keep fire out of heavier fuels (suppress in lighter fuels)
* Clear area around above-ground fuel tank, shutting off tank
* Place combustibles outside furniture inside the structure
* Charge and place sprinkler kits strategically around structure for immediate use
* Consider applying structural sprinkler kits if you have sufficient time and materials to support the sprinklers (do not cause water damage by applying the sprinklers before they are necessary).
