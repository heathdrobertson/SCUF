## IC

### HazMat Incident Priority

#### 3 Priorities

1. Life safety
2. Incident stabilization
3. Property and environment

{% hint style="info" %}
Most pertinent info is in the first paragraph of chapter.
{% endhint %}

## Developing Incident Action Plan (IAP)

Ch 25 Pg 1236

Strategies and tactics.

## Transfer of Command

Ch 27 Pg 1391

Who transfers command, former IC tells or transfers everyone of new commander.



## Safety Briefings

Ch 27 Pg 1402

Briefings happen:

1. Beginning of any incident.
2. When ever a change in incident and hazards.

## Situation Awareness

CH25 Pg 1230

1. Perception
2. Comprehension
3. Application

## Planning Division

CH 27 Pg 1390

Planning section gathers assimilates analyzes and processes information for effective decision making.



## Staging Areas

Ch 25 Pg 1244.

{% hint style="info" %}
again looking at that first paragraph for most of the information that you're going to 7:32 find uh reference to on the exam so 7:37 right off the bat first sentence again
{% endhint %}

The staging area needs to be located in an isolated spot in a safe area where occupants cannot interfere with ongoing operations. Staging areas should be located at spots in the **cold zone** where occupants cannot interfere with ongoing operations.

## Course Questions

...That evening, several neighborhood leaders get together and compare notes on the problems at the plant. Concerns are expressed about the now-frequent odor of ammonia, and the effects it may be having on the local community.

_The neighborhood leaders decide to hold a community meeting to share perspectives on the situation and determine what additional steps should be taken. If you were among this group of neighborhood leaders:_

**Who do you think should be invited to this initial meeting?**

Among those who would be appropriate to invite are the following: the Local Emergency Planning Committee, the Mayor’s office, the State Department of Natural Resources, company representatives and union officials from the meat packing plant, PTA leaders, the city attorney, fire inspection officials, and the emergency program manager.

**What information could you gather before the meeting that may be helpful?**

Prior to the meeting, you would want to request information on plant emissions from your State Emergency Response Commission and Local Emergency Planning Committee, and request other general information on plant conditions from the local fire department and the plant safety officer. In addition, you might want to research applicable standards for ammonia emissions. (The Title III “hotline” could be of some assistance.)

**What law(s) could the plant potentially be violating?**

Laws that could be violated include the Clean Air Act, the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and State environmental statutes.

**Assuming those you invited attended, what are some of the immediate follow-up actions that can be taken by members of the group to resolve the situation?**

Some possible actions—but by no means all of the actions that could be taken—include the following:

The county air quality office is asked to take measurements of air pollutants in the area and determine if there are violations of the Clean Air Act. The Local Emergency Planning Committee is asked to provide copies of the information collected under the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, and to determine if the facility is in full compliance with SARA. State natural resource officials, along with representatives of the Coast Guard and EPA, are asked to investigate the fish kills in the river and determine if there are any violations of the Clean Water Act, RCRA, and State environmental statutes. Union officials agree to ask OSHA to inspect the plant for compliance with health and safety standards. And the fire inspector agrees to check the plant for fire code violations.

All of these actions are, to a great extent, made possible by citizen interest and involvement.
