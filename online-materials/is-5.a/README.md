## Course Questions



### HAZARDOUS MATERIALS LEGISLATION

...That evening, several neighborhood leaders get together and compare notes on the problems at the plant. Concerns are expressed about the now-frequent odor of ammonia, and the effects it may be having on the local community.

_The neighborhood leaders decide to hold a community meeting to share perspectives on the situation and determine what additional steps should be taken. If you were among this group of neighborhood leaders:_

**Who do you think should be invited to this initial meeting?**

Among those who would be appropriate to invite are the following: the Local Emergency Planning Committee, the Mayor’s office, the State Department of Natural Resources, company representatives and union officials from the meat packing plant, PTA leaders, the city attorney, fire inspection officials, and the emergency program manager.

**What information could you gather before the meeting that may be helpful?**

Prior to the meeting, you would want to request information on plant emissions from your State Emergency Response Commission and Local Emergency Planning Committee, and request other general information on plant conditions from the local fire department and the plant safety officer. In addition, you might want to research applicable standards for ammonia emissions. (The Title III “hotline” could be of some assistance.)

**What law(s) could the plant potentially be violating?**

Laws that could be violated include the Clean Air Act, the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and State environmental statutes.

**Assuming those you invited attended, what are some of the immediate follow-up actions that can be taken by members of the group to resolve the situation?**

Some possible actions—but by no means all of the actions that could be taken—include the following:

The county air quality office is asked to take measurements of air pollutants in the area and determine if there are violations of the Clean Air Act. The Local Emergency Planning Committee is asked to provide copies of the information collected under the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, and to determine if the facility is in full compliance with SARA. State natural resource officials, along with representatives of the Coast Guard and EPA, are asked to investigate the fish kills in the river and determine if there are any violations of the Clean Water Act, RCRA, and State environmental statutes. Union officials agree to ask OSHA to inspect the plant for compliance with health and safety standards. And the fire inspector agrees to check the plant for fire code violations.

All of these actions are, to a great extent, made possible by citizen interest and involvement.

What impact would a hazardous materials incident cause on the Central City Elementary School? What resources does Central City have to respond to such an incident?

1. Toxic industrial chemicals could kill or seriously injury many children exposed to their vapor hazards. TICs have low TLVs or PELs which means they are toxic in very low levels.

What industries within Central City would be required to provide Tier I and II Reports to the LEPC? Why are these reports important?

1. Chemex Industries and Petrolux Pipeline, possibly the Pacific Railroad. &#x20;
2. These reports identify what chemicals are stored or are being brought into Central City. They identify the amount, their location of storage, and other information regarding their dangers to the community.

Where would you logically look for a Commodity Flow Survey of your area to identify what materials are being shipped through Central City via all transportation arteries?

1. The Local Emergency Planning Committee in your city or jurisdiction.
   1. Data on shipments by domestic establishments in manufacturing, wholesale, mining, and selected other industries.

What are the dangers of TIC? Why are they so hazardous to “first responders?”

1. The potential exists for first responders and surrounding populations located downwind or near such an industry to be exposed to levels that may impact their health.
2. TICs have low TLVs and PELs which means they are very toxic if “first responders” are exposed to their liquid or vapor hazards.

What are some signs that a chemical or biological agent may have been released in the Central City area?

1. The Allen Marshlands water may have an oily appearance, unusual algae growth, or white froth may be contaminated. Discolored soil, bare spots in the ground where vegetation has died off, dead animals, and the presence of metal drums or other specially designed containers also signal a potential problem.
2. Numerous complaints of people presenting to hospital and health care facilities with the same illnesses. Dead birds and other animals within the area. Unexplained odors or vapors in the area. Suspicious devices placed in highly traveled areas (i.e., malls and shopping centers).

What steps can the average citizen take to limit his/her exposure to CWA agents as well as a release of a TIC?

1. Know the location of these facilities and what materials are onsite. During a chemical release, get uphill and upwind from the materials if you are outdoors. If you are in the path of the plume at home, and unable to evacuate, close your windows and doors. Turn off your air conditioning. Do not allow air in from the outside. Remain calm, and listen to the news for any public broadcasts. These plumes will pass rather quickly. The public announcements will tell you what to do and where to go if you experience any signs and symptoms for the chemical released.

The best source for information on where hazardous materials are stored or released from fixed sites in your community is usually:

* [ ] Individual manufacturers
* [ ] The mayor’s office&#x20;

### HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND HUMAN HEALTH



The driver of a gasoline tanker unloading at a local service station leaves his truck unattended for a short period of time. When the driver returns to his truck, he finds that the service station’s underground storage tank has overflowed and more than 1,000 gallons of gasoline are covering the ground and flowing down the street.

A strong odor of gasoline covers the entire spill area and extends downwind for several blocks. People who live downwind of the incident notice the gasoline odor and become concerned: a well driller in the area reports the odor to the local 911 dispatch center, a nursing home in the area starts to move patients inside from an outdoor recreation yard, and teachers from a nearby elementary school begin to bring students indoors from recess. The driver of the tanker works furiously to shut off the truck’s delivery valves to halt the overflow; in the process, his pants and shoes become drenched with gasoline. Down the street from the service station, the gasoline is running into a roadside drainage ditch and soaking into the ground. Some of the product has also reached a small stream that flows through the area.

1. &#x20;_How would you assess the risk from this incident? What are some of the things to take into account when making your risk assessment?_
   1. The risk from this incident would have to be rated as high. Factors to be considered in your risk evaluation are: the presence of a school and a nursing home nearby, and the service station’s location in a residential area. The material involved is highly flammable, and a significant quantity of it has spilled onto the ground. In addition, gasoline can produce toxic effects even in relatively small quantities.
2. What routes of exposure might affect the people downwind of the spill? What routes of exposure might affect the driver of the tanker?
   1. The primary route of entry of immediate concern for people downwind of the spill would be inhalation. For the driver of the tanker, the routes of concern would be inhalation (from the vapors produced by the material on the ground and on his clothes) and direct skin absorption.
3. . Does the potential of a long-term exposure threat exist? If so, what type of exposure would this be?
   1. Yes, there is a potential for a long-term exposure threat. Since the gasoline is soaking into the ground along the side of the street, the potential exists for groundwater contamination. We know that there are wells in the area of the spill, so this groundwater contamination could result in a long-term exposure threat due to the ingestion of gasoline-contaminated water. In addition, if the contaminated ground is not removed or treated, the affected soil could present another possible long-term exposure threat.
4. What transport media (air, surface water, groundwater, soil) are involved in this incident? How are they involved?
   1. All transport media are involved in this case. The air is involved due to the volatilization of the gasoline that spilled. Soil became involved as the gasoline flowed into the roadside ditch. The groundwater has become involved due to the gasoline soaking into the ground. Finally, surface water has become involved due to the gasoline reaching the small stream that flows through the area.
5. Do the people in the nursing home and the students in the elementary school face any increased threats from exposure to gasoline fumes? If so, why?
   1. Yes, these two groups face an increased threat from the gasoline fumes. Hazardous chemicals usually have a greater effect on young children and the elderly, who may show signs and symptoms of toxic exposure at a lower level of exposure than other segments of the population.
6. While spraying pesticides, a farmer wears long pants, a long-sleeved shirt, and gloves. The farmer is trying to prevent contaminants from entering the body by:
   * [x] &#x20;Absorption
   * [ ] Inhalation
   * [ ] Ingestion
   * [ ] Injection
7. Midnight dumpers have been leaving toxic waste in an illegal dumpsite in the woods. The soil beneath the waste is highly porous. A nearby house has a well, which taps into this porous soil. Based on this limited information, through what medium is the well most likely to become contaminated?
   * [x] &#x20;Groundwater
   * [ ] Air
   * [ ] Soil
   * [ ] Surface water
8. You spill a toxic substance; you cough, and your eyes immediately begin to water. You are experiencing what type of exposure?
   * [ ] Chronic (Long term exposure)
   * [x] Acute (Short exposure)
9. You have just learned that a chemical you work with is a teratogen. What effect does this chemical have?
   * [ ] &#x20;Causes a permanent change in the genetic material (DNA)
   * [ ] Irritates the lining of the throat
   * [x] Increases the risk of physical defects in a developing embryo
   * [ ] Increases the risk of cancer
10. When you are about to have a serious operation, the anesthetist is likely to use a substance which is:
    * [ ] An irritant
    * [ ] A corrosive
    * [ ] An asphyxiant
    * [x] A CNS (central nervous system) depressant
11. Which of these groups would be likely to have the most extreme reaction to most types of toxic exposure?
    * [x] Children
    * [ ] Adult men
    * [ ] Adult women
    * [ ] Adolescents
12. Groundwater is least likely to be contaminated under what circumstances?
    * [x] The groundwater is protected by a relatively impermeable protective layer, such as clay
    * [ ] The waste is confined by an aged underground storage tank
    * [ ] The contaminants are highly soluble
    * [ ] The contaminants are persistent
